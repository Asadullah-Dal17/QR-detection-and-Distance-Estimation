# QR-detection-and-Distance-Estimation
QR code Detection and Distance Estimation opencv Python, it more accurate version of distance Estimation, 

- [x]  QR code detection :bulb:

- [x] Euclidean distance (to find the **width of QR code**, more *accurately*)
  
- [ ] Find Distance between camera and QR code
  
- [ ] Improve the vsual representation

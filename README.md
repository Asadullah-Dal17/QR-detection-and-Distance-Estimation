# QR detection and Distance Estimation using Single:one: camera :camera: opencv python :eye::eye:
QR code Detection and Distance Estimation opencv Python, it more accurate version of distance Estimation, 

- [x]  QR code detection :bulb:

- [x] Euclidean distance (to find the **width of QR code**, more *accurately*) :bulb:
  
- [x] Find Distance between camera:eye: and QR code :bulb:

- [x] Distance is calculated and Displayed on Screen :bulb: 
  
- [x] Improve the Visual representation :green_heart:
